## Project Description
<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# Sepsis Prediction<a name="about-project"></a>

**Sepsis Prediction** This project aims to develop a machine learning-based solution to predict whether a patient will develop sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by the body's response to an infection, which can lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death. Early detection and treatment are crucial for improving patient outcomes.
The project involves training several machine learning models to predict the likelihood of a patient developing sepsis based on various input features. These models are then deployed via an API, and a user-friendly interface is created using Streamlit to allow healthcare professionals to input patient data and receive predictions.

- **Data collection : Gathered comprehensive data on patients being tested for sepsis disease**
-**Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA): Examining and understanding the structure, patterns, and relationships within the dataset. This involved summary statistic, univariate analysis , bivariate analysis, outlier detection and handling missing values**
 **Data Cleaning: preparing the unified data ready for analysis**
 - **Visualizations: Using matplotlib and seaborn to create visually appealing charts, graphs and heatmaps to help answer the business questions**
 - **Answering Business questions: Using visualizations to answer business questions that help in analysing the dataset**
- **Hypothesis Testing: Testing formulated Hypothesis about whether Sepsis disease is common in elderly patients(40 years and above). Performing statistical analysis to test this hypothesis using Z-Test**
- **Data preparation : Transforming the dataset into a format suitable for training and evaluating ML models. Encompassing a range of tasks to improve the quality, consistency, and relevance of the data, ultimately leading to better model performance and insights. It involes checking if the data is balanced, feature engineering, data transformation, data splitting , constructing pipelines.**
- **Modelling : Creating mathematical representations (models) that learn patterns and relationships from the dataset in order to make predictions on whether a customer will churn or not.Data is trained both when balanced and unbalanced. The models trained include;Gradient_Boosting, Random_Forest, Stochastic_Gradient, SVC_Pipeline**
- **Hyperparameter Tuning : Hyperparameters are parameters whose values are set before the learning process begins. They control aspects such as the complexity of the model and its capacity to learn.Hyperparameter tuning helps improve model performance by finding the optimal settings.It prevents overfitting or underfitting of the model by adjusting hyperparameters.Proper tuning can lead to better generalization on unseen data.The steps include Use cross-validation to evaluate the performance of different hyperparameter settings.Consider the computational cost when choosing a tuning technique.Start with a coarse search space and refine it based on initial results.Monitor the performance metrics closely to avoid overfitting to the validation set.**

- **Feature Importance: Feature importance refers to a technique used to determine which features have the most significant impact on the target variable in a machine learning model.gher feature importance values indicate stronger influence on the model's predictions.Negative importance values suggest that the feature has a negative impact on the target variable.**
- **Model Evaluation : Model evaluation is the process of assessing the performance of a machine learning model on unseen data. It helps determine how well the model generalizes to new data and whether it meets the desired objectives. Classification Models:Accuracy: Measures the proportion of correctly classified instances.Precision: Measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.Recall (Sensitivity): Measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances.F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.**
- **saving the models: After training a machine learning model, it's important to save it for future use or deployment. Saving the model allows you to reuse it without the need to retrain from scratch.Joblib: Use libraries like Joblib or Pickle to serialize Python objects, including trained models, to disk.**

**A custom network named mynetwork is defined using the bridge driver. This network allows the API and client services to communicate with each other.**

**Building and Deploying the Docker Containers**
**Step-by-Step Process**
1. **Building the Docker Containers**
First, I built the Docker images for both the API and the Streamlit client using the following commands:
This command reads the docker-compose.yml file and builds the Docker images based on the specified build contexts (./api for the API and ./frontend for the client).

2. **Starting the Services with Docker Compose**
After successfully building the Docker images, I started both the API and the Streamlit client services using Docker Compose:
This command creates and starts the containers for both services, ensuring they are up and running. Docker Compose handles the network setup, so both services can communicate over the defined mynetwork.

3. **Accessing the Streamlit Application**
Once the services were up, I accessed the Streamlit application via the provided link:
This link opens the Streamlit interface in a web browser, allowing users to interact with the Sepsis Prediction application. The application presents a user-friendly form where patient data can be entered to predict the likelihood of sepsis.
